# Daily-challenge
This repository contains daily Verilog RTL implementations of fundamental digital design modules, created as part of a personal challenge to strengthen my VLSI design skills. Each module is written in clean, synthesizable Verilog code, focusing on core combinational and sequential logic essential for hardware design.
